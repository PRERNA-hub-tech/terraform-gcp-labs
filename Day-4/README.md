Day 4 â€“ Revision Notes (Load Balancer + MIG + Instance Template in GCP with Terraform)
1. Instance Template

Definition: A reusable configuration (blueprint) for creating VMs.

Contents:

Machine type (e.g., e2-micro)

Boot disk image (e.g., debian-11)

Metadata startup script

Network tags (e.g., http-server)

Service account & scopes

ðŸ‘‰ Why needed?
Instead of configuring each VM manually, we define one template and use it for a group of instances.

ðŸ“Œ Interview Qs:

What is an Instance Template?

Can it be updated? â†’ No, they are immutable. To change, you create a new one and update your MIG to use it.

2. Startup Script (Metadata)

Purpose: Automates instance setup on boot.

Example:

#! /bin/bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y apache2
systemctl start apache2
echo "Hello from $(hostname)" > /var/www/html/index.html


Ensures every VM in the MIG is ready to serve traffic.

ðŸ‘‰ Why important?
Without it, new instances would come up blank â†’ health checks fail â†’ LB backend unhealthy.

ðŸ“Œ Interview Qs:

What is a startup script and when would you use it?

Difference between startup script vs image baking? â†’ Startup script runs at boot, image baking builds everything into a custom image.

3. Managed Instance Group (MIG)

Definition: A group of identical VMs created from an instance template.

Features:

Autoscaling (based on CPU/utilization metrics)

Self-healing (replaces failed instances automatically)

Rolling updates (replace old template with new)

Terraform Resource:

resource "google_compute_instance_group_manager" "default" {
  name               = "web-mig"
  base_instance_name = "web"
  zone               = "us-central1-a"
  version {
    instance_template = google_compute_instance_template.web-template.self_link
  }
  target_size        = 2
}


ðŸ“Œ Interview Qs:

Difference between MIG and Unmanaged Instance Group (UIG)?

How does MIG handle failures?

How do you roll out an update to all VMs in MIG?

4. Firewall Rule

Why needed? â†’ By default, no inbound access.

Example:

resource "google_compute_firewall" "default" {
  name    = "allow-http"
  network = "default"
  allow {
    protocol = "tcp"
    ports    = ["80"]
  }
  target_tags = ["http-server"]
}


Opens port 80 for web traffic.

ðŸ“Œ Interview Qs:

How do you expose an application running in GCP?

Whatâ€™s the difference between firewall rule vs IAM policy?

5. Health Check

Used by LB to verify backend instance health.

Example:

resource "google_compute_health_check" "default" {
  name               = "basic-http-healthcheck"
  check_interval_sec = 5
  timeout_sec        = 5
  http_health_check {
    port = 80
  }
}


If instance doesnâ€™t respond â†’ marked unhealthy â†’ traffic wonâ€™t be routed.

ðŸ“Œ Interview Qs:

What happens if all backends fail a health check?

How is health check different from monitoring?

6. Backend Service

Connects health checks + MIG.

Defines:

Load balancing mode (e.g., UTILIZATION)

Protocol (HTTP)

Capacity allocation

ðŸ“Œ Interview Qs:

How does backend service distribute traffic?

What role does health check play in backend service?

7. Load Balancer (HTTP)

Components:

Backend Service â†’ MIG

Health Check

URL Map â†’ routes traffic

Target Proxy â†’ accepts requests

Forwarding Rule â†’ binds external IP + port

ðŸ‘‰ Classic Application Load Balancer in GCP.

ðŸ“Œ Interview Qs:

Difference between Global vs Regional LB in GCP?

Layer 4 vs Layer 7 LB?

How does LB interact with health checks?

8. Terraform Specific Concepts

lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }

Prevents accidental deletion of critical resources (like templates).

Immutability of Templates:

Terraform replaces instead of modifying.

Debugging MIG + LB:

Always check service status with systemctl.

Use curl localhost to validate app response.

ðŸ”‘ High-Level Architecture Recap

Instance Template â†’ defines VM config

MIG â†’ manages identical VMs

Startup Script â†’ ensures apps are installed/configured

Firewall Rule â†’ allows inbound traffic on port 80

Health Check â†’ validates VMs are serving traffic

Backend Service â†’ connects MIG to LB

HTTP Load Balancer â†’ distributes external traffic
